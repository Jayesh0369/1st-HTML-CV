    <h3>My hobbies</h3>
        <p>many people enjoy easy hobbies. One example of an activity that is easy for most people is swimming. <br> This hobby requires very little equipment, it is simple to learn, and it is inexpensive. <br> I remember learning to swim at my local swimming pool when I was a child, and <br> it never felt like a demanding or challenging experience. Another hobby that I find easy and fun is photography. <br> In my opinion, anyone can take interesting pictures without knowing too much about the technicalities of operating a camera.<br> Despite being straightforward, taking photos is a satisfying activity.</p>
